# Smart-Healthcare
Smart Healthcare is an integrated web-based healthcare solution that leverages Deep Learning for blood group detection from fingerprint images and provides a Doctor Appointment Booking system — delivering a seamless and efficient experience for both patients and healthcare providers.

🚀 Features

🔬 Blood Group Detection:

Uses fingerprint images and a trained Deep Learning model (CNN) built with TensorFlow & Keras.

Provides a non-invasive, quick, and cost-effective alternative to traditional blood tests.

👨‍⚕️ Doctor Appointment Booking:

Patients can book available time slots with doctors.

Doctors/hospitals can manage appointments efficiently.

🌐 Web Integration:

Backend powered by Flask & MongoDB.

Frontend built with React.js, styled using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap.

Model integration through Google Colab & Flask API.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Backend: Flask, MongoDB

Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras (trained in Google Colab)

Other Tools: Python, REST API
